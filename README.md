# xps-9370-linux
fix things on the Dell XPS 13 9370 on GNU/Linux

- added the default/grub file as a reference for the kernel parameters
  - wich enables the 9370 to go into deep sleep mode

- made scripts that disables bluetooth on suspend and re-enables it after it

- made a script and service that detects my eGPU NVIDIA setup on boot
